;;; init.el --- Bootstrap Emacs configuration

;;; Commentary:

;; This file loads Org-mode and then loads the rest of our Emacs
;; initialization from Emacs Lisp embedded in literate Org-mode files.

;;; Code:

(package-initialize)

;; Load up Org-babel
(require 'ob-tangle)

;; Load our main configuration file
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "emacs.org" user-emacs-directory))

;;; init.el ends here
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
